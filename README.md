# AutoLumber Bot

This is a fully automated lumberjack script for the Orion client on the UO Forever Shard by Kibbles. 

If you wish to contribute to the project or just talk about anything, please feel free to hit me up on discord. 

My discord username is Kibbles#9429.

## Requirements:
Lumberjacker skills:
- 120 Lumberjack
- 100 Healing
- 100 Swordsmanship
- 100 Anatomy
- 100 Tactics
- 64 Magery
- Anything you wish

The script will recall you to locations within your runebook, scan for and chop trees around you, recalls back to the bank set in your runebook (first rune), drops off the loot, and goes to the next lumber location.

Healing and fighting are also taken care of. Script will attack any mobs within 1 tile, chase it down, and loot its corpse.

Red detection is present but unreliable. Script will scan and detect Red players within 25 tiles and attempt to recall back to bank, drop off loots, and recall to the next lumber location to continue.

Things to set in the script:
    1) Runebook serial (Your runebook should have a bank spot rune and a recommended 5 or more lumber spots)
    2) Reg bag serial (This is a bag in your bank with the required reagents for recalling - BP | BM | MR)
    3) Drop bag serial (This is a bag in your bank to deposit your gold and logs)
    4) Create a list called 'LumberLoot' with all the items you would like to unload to your bank
    5) Create an ignore list called 'ignoreLoot' for the items you do not wish to loot
    6) Recall to your first lumber spot, run the script, and profit!

Enjoy!
